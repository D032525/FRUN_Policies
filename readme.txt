This project provides policies for Focused Run - Advanced Configuration Monitoring - Configuration and Security Analytics. 
Those policies are the basis for validating configuration items of systems which are stored centrally in Focused Run. 
Policies comprise a set of rules which are ideally derived from a hardening guide or a system baseline documention. 
Those policies are used to calculate compliance status of configuration items using application FRUN CSA Validation.
